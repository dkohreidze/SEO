`auto_link.py`

This Python script automates linking by searching for keywords within a text file and replaces the first instance of the keyword with an anchor text link to a specified URL. This script is pretty basic and only links exact matches - plurals, derivatives, and misspellings will not be linked. 

You must place keyword/URL pairs in the format of the examples provided in the script. You can add as many keyords/URL pairs as you like and keyword phrases are accepted.

To run this script, place the text files you want to crawl in the same directory as the script file. Open Terminal and `cd` into the directory where the script and text files are located. Exectute the script with `python auto_link.py`
